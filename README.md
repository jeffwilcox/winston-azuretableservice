Windows Azure Table Service Transport for Winston (Node.js)

The `winston-azuretableservice` module for Node.js + Winston apps lets you write log messages to the cloud with Windows Azure Table Service as the provider. The table service is a cost-effective logging area as the costs are the same as blob storage.
